<h1>TODO List CLI Application</h1>
This python project was generated using Microsoft Co-Pilot so i took on the challenge being relatively new to Python with the intentions of finishing it
as fast as i possibly could like i was under a deadline but while also being thorough with my code and making sure everything links and makes sense.
Here are a few reasons i started this project:
<ol>
    <li>I wanted to create a challenge for myself, so reading and writing files was the main challenge i faced here and completed it</li>
    <li>I needed a project that i could focus on and complete to a high enough standard for myself within a short time frame</li>
    <li>This project was completed in just under 2.5hrs, if there are any bugs feel free to let me know</li>
</ol>

<h1>Project uses</h1>
This project is for those who want a TODO List 'Application' but don't want to spend the money that comes with the online apps which are available. It can also be used just for testing purposes and anyone who wants to understand how the code works. Feel free to give me constructive feedback as this is my first major project within Python with many more yet to come.
